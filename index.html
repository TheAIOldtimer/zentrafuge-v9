            Zentrafuge is a calm AI space for veterans who feel isolated, overwhelmed,
            or stuck between military and civilian life. No judgement. No labels.
            Just a steady presence that listens and remembers.

          <h2>Built as a refuge, not a product.</h2>
          <p>
            Zentrafuge started as a personal project: a calm, always-there companion
            for people who live with too much noise in their heads and not enough
            safe places to talk. Over time, it became clear that veterans – especially
            those feeling forgotten or cut adrift – need this kind of space most.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're building slowly and carefully: encrypted memory, trauma-aware design,
            and no data-selling. The early Medway pilot will help us prove what works
            before we scale further.

            <li>A trusted AI companion tailored to each veteran</li>

            Zentrafuge is for the moments between. When it's too late to call anyone,

            <li>Set boundaries: what's on the table and what isn't.</li>
